**Discovery & Thoughts**

1. Trajectory plots & vanilla XGBoost on type classification indicate we can sensibly aggregate some types into one type (*Go over w/ Sam to see if this is okay tho!*)
* cargo ship & tanker: aggregate
* tug & towing: aggregate
* recreational & commercial fishing: agg; lobster boat looks interesting and can be treated as standalone


**Questions**

* Lot of vessel types out there, which ones are the higher priority
* class-b vessels don't have AIS labelled size ?
* Labels have a lot of 'birds/aves': what are these??

**TODO**

* Extract more info from notes?
