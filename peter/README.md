**Discovery & Thoughts**

1. Trajectory plots & vanilla XGBoost on type classification indicate we can sensibly aggregate some types into one type:
* cargo ship & tanker very similar: aggregate
* tug & towing: aggregate


**Questions**

* Lot of vessel types out there, which ones are the higher priority
* class-b vessels don't have AIS labelled size ?
* Labels have a lot of 'birds/aves': what are these??
